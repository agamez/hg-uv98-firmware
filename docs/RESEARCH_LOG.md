## Environment / tooling

| Tool | Status |
|---|---|
| REA MCP (rea-agents 6.5.0) + Ghidra 12.1.4 headless | Wired (`GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/ghidra_12.1.4_PUBLIC` in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`). 190416 image open as raw-binary, base `0x08000000`, `ARM:LE:32:v7`, cspec `default`. |
| Ghidra Thumb decode | **[confirmed] works**: e.g. `procedure_assembly`/`procedure_pseudo_code` at `0x08018B60` return coherent Thumb-2 + clean C. (REA docs claim Cortex-M unsupported; empirically the ARM analyzer resolves Thumb.) |
| Python | capstone, unicorn, pyelftools, pwntools installed. `binutils-arm-none-eabi` install was blocked by a system apt lock (retry pending, non-essential). |
| Reproducible recon | `tools/recon_map.py` regenerates all phase-1 artifacts into `analysis/` (git-ignored). |

REA evidence IDs (session `ses_ec03bcc16ffez5nk68G9l60uSt`): segments `ev_07df69f0…`, vector-table bytes `ev_0dcbcc6a…`, function dossier `ev_4ebffbe0…`.

## Image identity (all [confirmed], static)

| | 190416 (primary) | KT |
|---|---|---|
| SHA-256 | `733616010b6d…66b2` | `5a2a42e296…dbce` |
| Size | 273,303 B | 507,904 B |
| Mapped extent | `0x08000000–0x08042B96` | `0x08000000–0x0807BFFF` |
| Initial SP | `0x20006780` | `0x20006780` |
| Reset vector | `0x08044691` → **outside file** | `0x08044741` → inside, but lands on a data table |
| Vector table | 76 entries (16 system + 60 IRQ), 70 unique | 76 entries, 70 unique |
| Last non-FF byte | file end (mid-code truncation) | `0x08045B4D`; `0xFF` padding above |
| Version string | `V1.0.1_190416` @ `0x0803F900` | (KT equivalent not yet located) |

- Vector layout matches **STM32F103xE / GD32F103 high-density** (60 IRQs) exactly. **[confirmed]**
- **[confirmed] Both files are partial images, not runnable as distributed:**
  - 190416: truncated mid-code at `0x08042B94`; reset + fault handlers (13 vector entries at `0x0804468x–0x0804469x`) are beyond file end.
  - Both: IRQ-handler slots, PendSV (`0x0802B21A`/`0x0802B20E`), SysTick (`0x0802BD68`/`0x0802BD5C`) and Default-handler regions are filled with structured `0xBEEF` filler (e.g. 10-byte repeating unit `EFBE EFBE EFBE 0000 0000` per IRQ slot).
  - SP value and handler addresses appear **only** in the vector table — no startup code anywhere in either file.
  - Code **never** branches into BEEF regions (654 distinct BL/B.W targets in `0x0800B000–0x0802A000`, zero into BEEF) — the islands are vector-referenced only.
  - Mechanism unknown: dump-tool sanitization / protected-page read failure / update-payload format. **Open question O1.**

## Preliminary memory map (190416; [confirmed] boundaries, [probable] roles)

| Flash range | Content | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| `0x08000000–0x08000130` | Vector table (76 entries) | confirmed |
| `0x08000130–0x0800B000` | Low-entropy data: `0xFF` + byte patterns (`FF/BF/DF/9E` halfword-heavy); **byte-identical between the two builds** → static assets (fonts/icons/tables), not code | probable (graphics), confirmed (not code) |
| `0x0800B000–0x0802A000` | Dense valid Thumb code (100% sector decodability `0xB000–0x13000`); 654 distinct call targets | confirmed |
| `0x08029B60–0x0802E000` | `0xBEEF` placeholder islands (181 runs ≥32 B, ~5–6 KB total each image) + zero regions | confirmed bytes, role open (O1) |
| `0x0802F000–0x08034xxx` | Zeros / low-density data | probable (tables/BSS image) |
| `0x08034000–0x08042B94` | Strings (menus, AT commands, version), GB2312 text, bitmap/font data (`0x0803C000+`) | confirmed |
| missing tail | `0x08042B97–…`: startup/reset, fault handlers (190416). KT shows this region = more strings (`OK`, `MEM-CH:`, `%d.%`), tables (`I`,`D530`,`D536`,`D621`… = APRS/CTCSS?), then `0xFF` padding to `0x0807BFFF` | confirmed for KT |

RAM: SP top `0x20006780` → ~26.5 KB static+heap below. Detail pending (O3).

## Version diff (190416 vs KT) — [confirmed]

- 71.5% of the first 273,303 bytes differ, but this is dominated by address-shift cascade: the images share a byte-identical run `0x0800012C–0x0800A1BB` (~40 KB assets) and identical call-graph fingerprints (same 654 call targets, same call counts 343/211/200/168/156/124, shifted by a constant −0x18/−0xC).
- "Sure"→"OK" **confirmed**: 190416 has 3× `SURE` (`0x08041034`, `0x080419DC`, `0x08041A34`), KT has zero; KT has `OK  ` labels (`0x08041A54`, `0x08041AAC`, `0x0804498C`, `0x080449E4`) plus GB2312 确定/取消.
- Ident string `P3107` present in **both** images (`0x08041A2C` / `0x08041AA4`); `P3LL` absent from both (consistent with P3LL being a V1.2-only string — untestable, image not public).
- Real code-size delta between builds ≈ 0xB0 bytes (reset vector `0x08044690` vs `0x08044740`).

## Inter-MCU AT protocol — [confirmed] strings in the ARM image

`$D00,OK` `0x0804075C`; `$F00,OK` `0x08040764`; request/response tokens `$A00, $A01, $A02, $A08, $A09, $A10, $A11, $A12, $A30, $A31, $A50, $D00, $F00, $F01` clustered at `0x0804075C–0x080408xx`. Matches the 8051-side protocol from `repos/hg-uv98-firmware`. UART number and framing pending (O2).

## Prior-claims updates

| Claim | Status after recon |
|---|---|
| "Sure"→"OK" KT mod | **Confirmed** (string diff) |
| V1.2 uses `P3LL` vs `P3107` | `P3107` confirmed in both images; `P3LL` absent (neither image is V1.2) |
| AT commands over UART to APRS MCU | Command strings confirmed; UART/transport unverified |
| 128 channels, VHF/UHF ranges | Untested (needs EEPROM/struct analysis, Level 2) |
| CH340/USB bridge | Untested; clone-protocol location unknown |
| KT changes "UI text only" | Roughly true modulo address shifts; KT also carries extra tail-region content absent from 190416 dump |

## Prior-session log reconciliation

`docs/research_log.md` (untracked, from an earlier session; moved to `analysis/prior_session_log.md`) made claims verified/corrected as follows:

| Prior claim | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Reset handler = `0x0800C0E4` (`FUN_0800c0e4`) | **Wrong** — vector word[1] bytes are `91460408` = `0x08044691` (triple-checked: REA `read_bytes` + capstone + manual). `FUN_0800C0E4` is a real 1,394-B function in the code region (role unknown; possibly `main`); it is not the reset vector target. |
| Vector IRQ naming (EXTI0_TSC@0x38, …) | **Wrong** — entries [14]/[15] are PendSV/SysTick per ARMv7-M; [16]+ is the 60-IRQ F103xE layout. |
| uC/OS-II RTOS (`uC/OS-II Idle/Stat/Tmr` strings) | **Confirmed** — strings present in `analysis/strings_190416.json`. Main MCU runs Micrium uC/OS-II ⇒ a real PendSV context-switch handler exists on the device but is BEEF-stripped in the distributed file (supports O1 "sanitized dump"). |
| `FUN_08018B60` = EEPROM write | **Wrong** — pseudocode shows an LCD text renderer (x/y params, GB2312 2-byte chars advance 16 px, ASCII `+0x30` conversion). |
| `FUN_080198C0` strcpy-like, `FUN_080199A0` fill, `FUN_0801F598` strlen-like | Plausible, unverified — keep as leads. |
| 421 Ghidra procedures, 350 strings | Consistent with raw-binary auto-analysis; will grow with manual function seeding. |
| 190416 "238 KB of FF padding to 512 KB" | **Misleading** — the file simply stops mid-code at `0x08042B94` (no padding present; KT shows `0xFF` padding only above `0x08045B4D`). |

## Open questions

- **O1**: Why do both images carry BEEF handler islands? (dump sanitization vs update-payload format vs flasher-side patching). uC/OS-II ⇒ PendSV/SysTick handlers must exist on-device; only the distributed copies are stripped. Next: locate the radio's update/clone tool behavior; compare with the KT .exe/updater artifacts; check `docs/COMMUNITY.md` for how these files were distributed.
- **O2**: Which UART (and framing) carries the AT protocol? Next: find `$A0x` string xrefs from code, trace to USART peripheral init (RCC/APB base `0x4000xxxx`).
- **O3**: RAM map / global data layout (0x20000000–0x20006780). Next: analyze literal-pool RAM references. uC/OS-II task TCBs/priority tables expected.
- **O4**: True file-format semantics of the two .bin files (full flash dump vs flashable payload). Affects any future Level-4 work; irrelevant to functional recovery.
- **O5**: The `0x08000130–0x0800B000` asset region: identify format (font bitmaps? splash? index tables).
- **O6**: uC/OS-II task list: find `OSStart`/task creation, enumerate tasks/priorities. `FUN_0800C0E4` (1,394 B, 55 blocks) is a candidate `main()`.

## Session log

### 2026-10-15 — Session 1: reconnaissance (phase 1)

Done: REA/Ghidra wiring (client restart); image identity; vector table; sector maps; BEEF-structure analysis; branch-target census; strings extraction; cross-version diff; prior-claim verification (Sure→OK, P3107); Thumb-decode validation via REA (`FUN_08018B60` dossier); recon script `tools/recon_map.py`.

Not started: decompilation of subsystems, call graph, RAM map, protocol framing, EEPROM structures.

**Next actions (prioritized):**
1. **Call-graph + subsystem map** (REA `list_procedures`, `procedure_callees` on hot functions; anchor: most-called `0x08018B60` display renderer, `0x0802289A`, `0x080198C0`, `0x08017A8C`). Deliver: function inventory with roles.
2. **AT-protocol path** (O2): xrefs to `$A0x` strings → framing/UART functions → confirm UART4 hypothesis.
3. **Main loop / reset scaffold** (scaffold; real startup code is absent): identify `main()` via init patterns and menu dispatch.
4. **RAM map** (O3) and channel/EEPROM structures (needs AT24C512 access code + 8051-source cross-reference).
5. Retry `binutils-arm-none-eabi` install when apt lock frees (non-essential).
